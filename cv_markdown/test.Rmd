```{r,comment = NA}

Gender <- gl(2,1000,labels = c("Men","Women"))
SmokerM <- sample(c("Y","N"),1000,replace = T , prob = c(.3,.7))
SmokerW <- sample(c("Y","N"),1000,replace = T , prob = c(.5,.5))
Smoker <- c(SmokerM,SmokerW)

mydata  <- data.frame(Gender,Smoker)
table(mydata$Gender,mydata$Smoker)
knitr::kable(table(mydata$Gender,mydata$Smoker))
```

This is a text in the body of the document.What font is this ? What is
font for the output of table ? How can we change these 2 fonts ? What 
other categories of items are there in an Rmarkdown which have different
fonts ?
